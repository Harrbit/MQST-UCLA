# MQST-UCLA
Coursework and many other stuff for the Master of Quantum Science and Technology program at University of California, Los Angeles. This repo contains files for different courses, as well as labs and projects the author had taken part into. the supporting_doc folder contains all the documents given to students, as well as my notes taken in classes. 

**These are badly written codes mostly written several hours before the ddl for homeworks, but somewhere in these trash exist one or two files I actually like**

Below is a cataloge for folders in this repo.

## [Ensamble_Quantum_Computing](ensamble_quantum_computing)

Implementation of two-qubit Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm using NMR quantum computer, starting from basic operations such as Free Induction Decay all the way up to the altorithm itself, the data and report included

## [Quantum_Algorithm](quantum_algorithm)

Some of the more modern quantum algorithm explored, implementation of some algo is done in the form of homeworks.

    hwk1: A terrible proof of Gottesman-Knill theorm
    hwk2: A implementation of Amplitude Amplification, which can be treated as a generalized version of Grover's algo.
    hwk3: An implementation of block encoding


## [Quantum_Programming](quantum_programming)

The basic of the basic, starting from Deutsch-Jozsa, we went through the famous beginner routine for quantum computing, computer science wise. This folder contains mainly trash, but there is on interesting implementation of QAOA using IBM platform which is kinda cool
